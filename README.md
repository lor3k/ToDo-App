## ToDo-App

#### ToDo Application allows you create list with tasks and set it to your browser local storage.

If you would like to add list to your website, copy `script2.js` and join it to your html file.
You could create as many list as you want - simply add next by `new ToDo('div#cont')` where `div#cont` is container, where you will put your new list.

List sets in local storage key `taskList` and create JSON with key-value pairs, where key is date stamp and value is array with task title and task content `taskList = {123123:['task title','task content'],...}` 

You can check this app [here](http://todoapp2018.surge.sh). 

Thanks for any comments and opinions.
